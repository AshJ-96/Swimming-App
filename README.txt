Swimming Club App'

An app for the members of a swimming club allowing them to share events,
also called Galas, and also share their fastest times on the 4 different 
Main swimming strokes.

I initially wanted to use a splash-page as a replacement for the "about"
one.

one side Nav with personal information, on the left.
one side Nav with sharing options and the about page on the right.

The two side Navs shall be adjusted to look like swimming lanes from above.

The Strokes fragment will have a spinner to cycle the placemark style cards. 
Strokes, 
-Front crawl
-Back stroke
-Breast stroke
-Butterfly
There shall be the option for additional details. Records time, date done, 
distance.

Events page,
-Date,
-Time, 
-Place, Google Maps?
-Reason? String

Icon for app-Webbed hand

I have imported the xml, activities and helpers from my previous concept manager app, and plan to adjust them for the Events page
